# TrackMe

This repository contains the Software Engineering II project (2018-2019) by Alberto Archetti and Fabio Carminati, consisting in the definition of the following documents:

:triangular_flag_on_post: [Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (**RASD**)](https://github.com/archettialberto/ArchettiCarminati/blob/master/RASD/RASD2.pdf)

:hammer_and_wrench: [Design Document (**DD**)](https://github.com/archettialberto/ArchettiCarminati/blob/master/DD/DD1.pdf)

The course, held by Prof. Elisabetta Di Nitto, belongs to the Computer Science and Engineering track for the Mater of Science degree provided by [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

## Specification

The rules are available [here](https://github.com/archettialberto/ArchettiCarminati/blob/master/Mandatory%20Project%20Assignment%20AY%202018-2019.pdf). In short, the goal of this project is to write two documents related to an imaginary but complex setting in which a company, **TrackMe**, wants to develop a software-based service, called **Data4Help**. **Data4Help** is a data collection service aimed at analyzing user data and sharing it with third parties. Among the features provided by **Data4Help**, there is **AutomatedSOS**, an emergency notification service autonomously activated when the user data crosses predefined thresholds.

:triangular_flag_on_post: The [**RASD**](https://github.com/archettialberto/ArchettiCarminati/blob/master/RASD/RASD2.pdf) is aimed at describing scenarios, use cases, goals, and requirements related to **Data4Help**. Its contents comprise:
1. the problem introduction (purpose, scope, definitions),
2. the problem description (product perspective and functions, expected user characteristics, assumptions, dependencies, constraints),
3. interface, functional, performance, and design requirements,
4. formal analysis using [Alloy](https://alloytools.org/).

:hammer_and_wrench: The [**DD**](https://github.com/archettialberto/ArchettiCarminati/blob/master/DD/DD1.pdf) provides the functional description of the **Data4Help** system, organized as:
1. architectural design (component, deployment, and runtime views, component interfaces),
2. user interfaces,
3. requirement traceability,
4. implementation, integration, and test plan.
