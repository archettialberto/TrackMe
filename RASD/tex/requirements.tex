  \subsection{Scenarios}

\subsubsection{Stroke detection} % FABIO ho fatto alcune correzioni allo scenario 1. Visto che Ã¨ la parte della quale ti sei occupato tu, preferisco non procedere e chiederti prima se ti vanno bene; ho cambiato qualcosina nel testo e corretto un paio di sviste grammaticali
    \label{sec:}

      Luke is a 65 years old man that after 40 years of work at the post office finally got retired. Because of the sedentary nature of his work he is worried that he may suffer a stroke.\\
      In order to monitor his health parameters, % FABIO tolto last week; cambiato today in "after some days" per rimanere generico
      he downloads the \texttt{Data4Help} app. The system allows him to create an account after filling all the required information(see Table~\ref{tab:login}). The system explicitly asks Luke if he wants to join the \texttt{AutomatedSOS} service and Luke accepts sharing his heartbeat and myocardial with the app. \\The system will now on check in real time Luke's health parameters that will be collected through his smartwatch. % FABIO potremmo aggiungere che ha un braccialetto col battito cardiaco, altrimenti non si capisce bene come faccia il sistema a rilevare i suoi parametri

      After some days Luke's health parameters exceede thresholds because of a stroke: the system recognizes immediatly the critical situation and forwards in less than 5 seconds an emergency notification to SOS system, providing the Luke's GPS location and health status feedback.


    \subsubsection{Scenario 2}

    The franchise BodySlim is opening a new gym in Milan near Parco Sempione;the most relevant aspect that characterize it, is the timetable:open 365 days, 8 hours per day. \\In order to maximize the revenue the management would like to know in which time of the day the potential customers make exercise.\\A reliable sample can be obtained from Data4Help, therefore BodySlim create a third party account filling all the required third party information (see Table 1). \\Then the franchise make an anonymous-group request (see Table 2) for 2000 individuals with particular characteristics: age between 20 and 60,at least once a week they are running in Parco Sempione(this can be checked with GPS position) to Data4Help. \\The app find in his internal database these 2000 users and therefore the system immediately shares the required information with BodySlim without asking to the users the authorization .\\Now looking at the most common hours chosen for running by these individuals the manager can easily identify the most profitable hours in which the gym should be opened.
    %Otherwise if the research is not successfully, Data4Help denied the request of BodySlim which has to find another way to obtain a reliable sample.
    %NO ALTERNATIVES:THIS IS AN EXAMPLE/AN APPLICATION

    \subsubsection{Scenario 3}

    Rose has just discovered that is expecting a daughter. Harold, her gynecologist, needs to keep monitoring bloody ossygen,electrocardiogram and pulse in order to understand if the pregnancy is proceeding well or not. \\Therefore he creates a third party account of Data4Help and after the system has checked if the required information(see Table 1) has been correctly inserted, he requires these data to the app. \\According to the single-user request(see Table 2)  policy Data4Help asks to Rose the consensus for sharing these data. Rose,which really care about her daughter's health, immediately gave the authorization to the app that can make them available to her gynecologist.\\ Nine months later the beautiful and healthy Marie is born.
    %her motherRose which is worried about her privacy, wouldn't like to share his personal data anymore so decides to unsubscribe to Data4Help. The system after having received the request, delete her Dataset and her account. From now on neither the gynecologist nor Data4Help will be able to access to Rose's data.

    \subsubsection{Scenario 4}

    Jack is a policeman that has decided to spend his holidays in a spa called "BeautySPA" which allow him to loss 15 kg thanks to fitness activity and a healthy diet.In order to understand if this treatment is efficient over time the spa and Jack decides that user's health parameters like height,weight and body temperature must be monitored. \\Therefore the policeman and BeautySPA create respectively a user and a third party account of Data4Help and the system ,after checking that all the required information (see Table 1)are properly added, allow them to exploit all Data4Help functionalities.\\ Indeed  BeautySPA immediately apply for the three Jack's health parameters to the app. \\The app recognize this as a single-user request(see Table 2)  so asks to Jack the authorization whether to provide them to the spa or not. \\Obviously he accept and therefore Data4Help make available these data. \\Unfortunately after just 1 month the policeman has already had a weight increase of 6 kg. So in order to better understand which may be the reasons the spa asks more health parameters such as blood oxygen and heartbeat to Data4Help which again,before sharing these data with BeautySPA, will ask the authorization of the user.

     \subsubsection{Scenario 5}
     Paul is studying Telecommunication Engineering at Politecnico di Milano and would like to partecipate at the PolimiRun therefore he is training twice a week since January(the PolimiRun occurs in May).\\ The telecommunication student decides to create a User Account sharing heartbeat and blody ossygen with Data4Help. \\The system checks that all the required information are properly added then it starts to periodically collect the two user data entries creating a Dataset for the student. 
%ALBERTO controlla se ti convincono data entry,dataset usate cosi
\\At the end of April Paul is worried that despite all the efforts the PoliRun is beyond his physical capacities so he resolves to unsubsribe to that competition but then remember that Data4Help lets the users to see in a personalized way all the data collected provided that they are logged in their account. \\Consequently Paul,after the login in, asked to the app to show his blody ossygen and heartbeat from January to April. \\The system retrieves the required data and make them available to the student through the graphical interface of the app.\\ In this way Paul can see the evolution of these two health parameters during the four months and immediately understands that the PolimiRun is absolutely realistic for him thanks to an impressive improvement in the concentation of blody ossygen and a reduction of heartbeat per minute.

    \subsubsection{Scenario 6}
    FastAndEasy, a car-sharing company, has a business model based on how much time his users rent one of his car in a week. After 5 years the society has to decide whether change this model with a new one based on the kilometers travelled in a week or keep going with the old one. \\In order to take the right decision FastAndEasy needs to know the GPS location of all of his users when they are driving his cars(so not 24 hours a day) for 3 months.\\ Because of this is a temporary solution it will be a waste of money for the car-sharing company to implement his own system for picking up these data. Therefore FastAndEasy creates a third party account of Data4Help filling all the required third party information (see Table 1) and asks to the app to provide the GPS location only of his users(which can be identified by the fiscal code).\\ This is a Single-user(Table 2) request therefore  Data4Help will ask directly to the specified users whether accept or deny it.\\ Indeed only for the users who accept the request the app will grant the access to their GPS location to the company which,  looking at the data collected after 3 months, can compute the possible earnings of the new model,compare them with the old ones and finally make a decision.

  \subsection{Performance requirements}
  \label{sec:performance}

    \textbf{AutomatedSOS} implements a very important function:monitoring the human health; in this field having a lower time response can save a life.\\
    Therefore, when the system detects than at least one of the health parameters exceedes the thresholds (user is in health danger),it must collect all the required data(GPS location and user's health status) and send them through an emergency call to an external service(SOS System) within 5 seconds.\\
    Moreover Data4Help has to send every 1 second the required data to the subscribed third parties(both for Single-User requests and for Anonymous-Group requests) in order to grant them accurate enough data.

    \texttt{AutomatedSOS} time performances are critical: the emergency call must be delivered no more than 5 seconds after the health danger detection, in order to have an ambulance dispatched from the SOS system as soon as possible. It is important to note again that \texttt{AutomatedSOS} is in charge only of the emergency call.

  \subsection{Design constraints}
    \subsubsection{Standards compliance}
%TODO decidere se giÃ  descitto in 2.4.3

    \subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The smartphone, in which the app(both for User account and Third Party Account) is downloaded, must guarantee that all the system functionalities can be correctly performed; hence the only compatible smartphones are the ones with : iOS or Android as operating system,3G/4G connection and can retrieve GPS location. \\ Moreover is necessary that each user has his own physical device and this device must be able to collect all the data that the user decides to share with the app otherwise the system won't be able to perform the Data Gathering function(\ref{sec:datagathering}).

    \subsubsection{Any other constraint}
%TODO Superfluo?
  \subsection{Software system attributes}

    \subsubsection{Reliability}

      The sofware is expected to work continuously for 24 hours a day despite small deviations are accepted. \\
      Moreover as section 3.6.4 says, the sofware changes during time, so each time the software is modified is necessary to check the consequences on the reliability.

    \subsubsection{Availability}

      The system is expected to be available for 99.99 \% of the time but in case of failure it must be able to recover within 1 second otherwise in case of user's health problem AutomatedSOS won't respect the constraint descibed in \ref{sec:performance} and therefore the user will be in a critical situation.\\ There 2 different situations which may result in a failure:failed components or due to unexecpected increasing in the requests. \\At this level of abstraction is not strickly required but in both of these cases a distributed architecture is an optimal solution:indeed in case of failure one of the redundant component can replace the one offline and in case of high demand a load balancing between redundant component can minimize the probability of failure of the system.

    \subsubsection{Security}

      The system requires the users(both Data4Help and AutomatedSOS) and third Parties(only in Data4Help), in order to exploit all the functionalities of the app and avoid unauthorized access, to authenticate through email and password.\\ These 2 credentials and all the Data collected by the system has to be securely stored in the internal database.\\ Moreover as  requirement \texttt{R.D6} says for privacy issues for all the Anonymous-Group requests the system must not allow the third parties to link data collected to the users that produced them.

    \subsubsection{Maintainability}

      Data4Help, as \ref{sec:datagathering} says, has to collect data through multiple physical wearables devices therefore Data type handling should be implemented by the system in a flexible and extensible way, because wearables technologies change rapidly and our software should adapt in the least invasive way possible.

    \subsubsection{Portability}

      The system has to gather user's data through multiple devices as \ref{sec:datagathering} says. Therefore, must be guarantee that different physical wearables can easily send data to this product function for example thanks to some form of abstraction. In this way I will also have a significant cost reduction and an improvement in maintainability of the system.
