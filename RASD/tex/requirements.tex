\section{Specific requirements}
\label{sec:specreq}

\subsection{Scenarios:}
%  \subsubsection{Scenario 1:}
%Luke is a 65 years old man that after 40 years of  working at the post office finally got retired.Because of the sedentary nature of his work he is worried that he may suffer a stroke.Therefore Luke downloads AutomatedSOS,create an account and shares with it his age,weight,heartbeat and GPS location. From now if he will unfortunately suffer a stroke the app within 5 seconds will call an ambulance.

%\subsubsection{Scenario 2:}
%The franchise BodySlim is opening a new  gym in Milan near Parco Sempione;the most relevant aspect that characterize it, is the timetable:open 365 days, 8 hours per day. In order to maximize the revenue the management would like to know in which time of the day the potential customers made exercise. In order to have a reliable sample BodySlim create a third party account and asked Data4Help to provide a sample of 2000 individuals with particular characteristics: age between 20 and 60,at least once a week they are running in Parco Sempione(this can be checked with GPS position).Now looking at the most common hours chosen for running by these individuals the manager can easily identify the most profitable hours in which the gym should be opened.

%\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
%FastandEasy,car-sharing company, has a business model based on how much time the user rent one of his car in a week. After 5 years the society has to decide whether change this model with a new one based on the kilometers travelled in a week or keep going with the old one. In order to take the right decision is decided to ask the user to share their GPS location with the company for 3 months. Because of this is a temporary solution it will be a waste of money for FastandEasy to implement his own system for picking up these data. Therefore the company creates a third party account of Data4Help and asks the GPS location only of the users of the car-sharing society. This is a request for specific DataSets therefore before giving the data, Data4Help will ask directly to the user which can deny or approve it. After 3 months looking at the GPS location the company can compute the possible earnings of the new model,compare them with the old ones and finally make a decision.

    %\subsubsection{Allow a Third Party to access at a speficy DataSet prior User Authorization}
    %	\subsubsection{Allow a Third Party to access at  group of anonymous DataSets made by at least 1000 individuals}
    %check whether the data fits with the request of the third party
    %	\subsubsection{Activation of AutomatedSOS must be granted in case of need}
