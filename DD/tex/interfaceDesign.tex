\section {User Interface Design}
\label{sec:ui}

  In this secrion we provide further details on the interface design of the Application. In the RASD document we provided a set of mockups that represent the overall feel of the Application screens. Here we will provide the navigation flow between the screens. The adopted syntax is \textbf{bold} for buttons, \textit{italics} for screens (referenced by figure number in the RASD document) and square brackets for conditional branches.
